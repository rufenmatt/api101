I am
dust particles in sunlight.
I am the round sun.
I am the morning mist,
and the breathing of evening.
I am wind in the top of a grove,
and surf on the the cliff.
I am a tree with a parrot in it’s branches
silence, thought, and voice.
The musical air coming through a flute,
a spark off a stone, a flickering in metal.
Both the candle and the moth, crazy wound it.
Rose and the nightingale
lost in the fragrance.
I am all orders of being,
the circling galaxy,
the evolutionary intelligence,
the lift and the falling away.
What is and what isn’t.
You, who know me,
You, the One in all, say
Who I am…
Say I am You.
- Rumi
